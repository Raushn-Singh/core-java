1. Introduction
Q) What is the difference between process,procedure,processor?
Ans:
---
Process : flow of execution to perform a particular task.
procedure : set of instructions to represent a particular task.
processor : H/W component to generate processes


1. Single process mechanism or single process Tasking
-----------------------------------------------------
it allows only one process mechanism or single Tasking

DrawBack
--------
1. allows only one process to execute the complete applications
2. allows to load and execute only one task at a time 
3. it follows Sequential execution
4. it will increase applications execution time
5. it will reduce applications performance
6. we are able to utilize System resources effectively

2. Multi Process mechanism or multi Tasking
-------------------------------------------
it allows more than one process to execute applications

1. Allows more than one process to execute the complete applications
2. Allows to load more than one  task at a time
3. it follows parallel execution
4. it will reduce application execution time
5. it will increase application performance 
6. we are unable to utilize System resources effectively


Context-switching

1. Heavy weight context-switching
---------------------------------
it is the context switching between two heavy weight components. 
Ex :
---- 
Context switching between two processes
1. it will increase execution time 
2. it will take more memory
3. it will reduce application performance


2.Light weight context-switching
--------------------------------
1. it is the context switching between two light weight components.
Ex:
----
Context switching between two Threads.
1. it will reduce application execution time 
2. it will increase application performance
3. it will take less memory .

Q) what is difference between Process and thread ?
Ans:
----
Process is heavy weight , it will take more memory execution time and more memory and it will reduce application performance.
Thread is light weight it will take less memory and less execution time and it will improve application performance




2. Threads Design
-----------------



3. Thread lifeCycle
---------------------
4. Thread Class library
-----------------------

5. Synchronization
------------------
6. Inter thread Communication
-----------------------------

7. Deadlocks
--------------
8. Thread local
