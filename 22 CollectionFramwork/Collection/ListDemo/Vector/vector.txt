Vector:
------
---> it was introduced in jdk1.0 Version
---> it is legacy Collection.
---> it is a direct implementation class to list interface

---> it is indexed based 
---> it allow duplicate elements.
---> it follows insertion order
---> it does not follow sorting order.
---> it allows Heterogeneous element
---> it allows more than one null element

---> its initial capacity is 10 elements.
---> its internal Data Structer is resizable Array
---> its incremental capacity ratio is 
new_Capacity=2*Current_Capacity
---> it best option for our frequent retrival operation

---> it is sysnchronized Collection
---> majority of method are synchronized methods in Vector
---> it allows only  one thread at a time
---> it allows sequntial execution
---> it will increase execution time
---> it reduce application performance
--->it is  giving gurantee for data consistency
---> it is  threadsafe

Constructors
------------
1.public Vector()
--> it can be used to construct an empty Vector object with the default capacity 10
2.public Vector(int capacity)
3.public Vector(int capacity, int incremental_Ratio)
4.public Vector(Collection c)


methods
-------
public void addElement(Object element)
public void firstElement()
public void lastElement()
public boolean removeElement(Object element)
public void removeElementAt(int index)
